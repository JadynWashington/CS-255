An overview of CS-255


1.Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass offers an improved solution for student drivers to prepare for their written driving exams and book sessions to practice for their road tests. They aimed to develop a website where users can create accounts, buy study packages, complete practice exams online, and schedule driving practice appointments. Additionally, DriverPass employees must be able to assist by purchasing packages and setting up appointments on behalf of customers.


2.What did you do particularly well?

I am extremely proud of the diagrams I created for Project 2. They were clear and effectively illustrated the main concepts of the application.

3.If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel that I couldve done better on going into more detail in the business requirements document 


4.How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed the user’s requirements and gathered feedback to understand their needs. I then incorporated these insights into the system design, focusing on intuitive navigation and clear workflows to help users easily achieve their goals.


5.How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

I believe software design should integrate both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down provides a broad overview, while bottom-up focuses on building functionality step by step. Both methods ensure the system works at every level.
Effective design starts with gathering requirements, then creating diagrams to show both high-level and low-level functions. Once these steps are completed, the design can be implemented to meet the client’s expectations.
